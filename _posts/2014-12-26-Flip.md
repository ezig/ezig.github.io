title: Flip (A game about tiles)
---

[Flip]({{ site.url }}/flip) is a tile-based game built using Phaser.js that I've worked on over the past week that I want to introduce.

Flip is based on a really simple goal (turn all of the red tiles white) and a really simple mechanic (flipping over a tile also flips the adjacent tiles). Right now, there are two modes: 

* **Classic**: randomly generated square levels from 3x3 up to 5x5.
* **Adventure**: hand-crafted levels of varying shapes. 

I'm really excited about Flip because I finally made a game that looks and feels _polished_. A lot of thought went into making the game look clean. I've fiddled around with game development for a long time, but most of my projects have gotten stuck in ugly prototypesâ€“ if they made it that far.

Furthermore, I'm quite happy with the way I designed the code. Both game modes are handled by the same game state with a few options passed in, and I made it really easy to add new levels.

Next, I'm looking to add more a lot more levels (Adventure mode currently has just more than 30) and also add new tile types to make sure that the levels stay exciting.

I also plan to port Flip to iOS and get it on the App Store (along with [Budget Buddy](https://github.com/ezig/CS50-final)!). This should be fairly easy using UIWebView and then adjusting the game scale for a smaller screen.

In the meantime, you can play Flip [here]({{ site.url }}/flip) right now!
